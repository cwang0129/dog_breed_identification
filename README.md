## Introduction:
On reddit.com, there is a section called "Awwwww". Many people will ask question about what kind of dog is this for one particular post. It inspired me to creat a bot who can answer this question automatically. 


## Data Description:

Number of categories: 120

Number of images: 20,580

## Project scope:
* Be able to identify 120 breeds of dog. If the dog isn't in 120 categories, consider it as mixed breed. 
* Find the optimized number of layers and hyper parameters by running forward probagation and backward probagation. 
* Solving the mixed breed difficulty.
* Solving the similar object difficulty, such as muffin and dogs

## Potential Problems:
* running time issue
* objects that looks similar on pictures, such as muffin and dog
* mixed breed
